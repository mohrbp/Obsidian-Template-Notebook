# Notes
- I was getting annoyed at how long my tables were and particularly dealing with the horizontally
- added a css snippet 
	- block-langauge-dataviewjs
	- https://forum.obsidian.md/t/scrollable-dataview-table/29009/5

```css
.block-language-dataviewjs   {
    display: block;
    height: 400px;
    overflow: auto;
```

- This is definitely also worth following
	- https://forum.obsidian.md/t/live-filtering-of-dataviewjs-table/66022
	- https://github.com/anareaty/obsidian-snippets/tree/main
	- Looks like they are actively working on it, but may also be a decent example of large js utilities 
# Tasks
