# Notes
## Meta
- Its probably not great that I keep making aggregation notes that handle specific kinds of tasks across projects
	- I don't mind the idea of aggregation notes for topics - that probably even makes sense
	- But I'm losing the atomicity of the individual notes this way 
		- This is yet another nested notes scenario
- Is the Comms note the same as the Email review note?
	- Probably and just of varying lengths?
		- Consider how to link and nest the chains of emails
			- Easiest is to keep the chain in a single note
## Comms
- Messaged James C instead of Michael M since he was OoO 
	- ![Chatting with James to get deets](02%20Projects/I1017%205_7%20Assay%20Platform/Project%20Management/notebook/2023-07-25-StewardshipFollowupMeeting.md#Chatting%20with%20James%20on%20Nutrition)
