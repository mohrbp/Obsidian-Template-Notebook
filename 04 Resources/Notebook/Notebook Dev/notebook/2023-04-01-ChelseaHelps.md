# Notes
- Project notes are good and needed
	- Try to imitate the Jira categories
- Need to be able to track work over time - boards are good for that because you can change priority and status without assigning dates
- STOP Scheduling stuff out
	- Just make a priority level


Do not need atomic task notes - multiple tasks within a note is manageable
- Can probably use both Tasks and Dataview to accomplish this
	- Can probably filter tasks by project that are on cards within a particular board status (used across project boards) to only show tasks which are a priority?
	- In some views can use progress bars 
- Need forwarding to split up tasks that were larger than initially scoped 
	- Visualizing a chain of notes
		- How
			- Table - relational?
			- Canvas - how to paste and link?
			- Board - doesnt handle splitting
			- Project note - At least its all together
	- How to correctly chain
		- Backlinks - 
			- Maybe look at excali-brain or a mind mapper to capture these links
		- Tags
			- This is useable, but becoming a mess - I think YAML is just much easier
			- Can you move your tags to YAML? - Yes, but probably shouldn't yet - wait for new Obsidian YAML changes 
			- In a way, your nested tags are your project pages and you may be able to use this to short cut building them
		- Combination of YAML
			- Idk if multi-array yaml is a good idea yet 
				- Formatting seems variable - not sure which plugin to use to keep it clean
				- Doesn't seem recognized as a useful category in the PM apps
