# Notes
- Continuing to work through the vault adjustments I made over last week
	- Changed dates to ISO (YYYY-MM-DD)
	- Moving to atomic notes for daily topics 
		- Enable better addressing the meta data on them and sorting the tasks I do
	- Establishing a method for triaging tasks that don't get completed when assigned
		- Intentionally don't have a section for tasks not associated with a card

- Points of trouble that I am having so far
	- Need to make a method to forward a task to a new note - either for triage or follow-on
		- Triaging tasks shouldn't just move them around, there should be a trail behind that task
		- Many tasks have follow-ons that could be their own note
			- Generally these are linked by being in the same project (i.e. tagged the same) and sometimes I remember to include a back reference
	- Catching all of the tasks that fall through my triage (i.e. all of the not done stuff from the past several months)

- Thoughts on atomic notes so far
	- Button was a good idea 
		- May want to auto-fold headers for a cleaner note; but worse on review in weekly note I think
		- CSS would be nice to delineate items individually (maybe depending on project too???)
	- The only way to meaningfully integrate with Obsidian Projects and the database approach.
	- Naming/MetaData is hard 
		- Still not sure how to properly recover old notes on a topic
		- Do they all need to be aggressively dated? Or does the yaml handle that?
		- Are unique names helpful?
		- Still not sure what metadata should all be included - what works in projects obviously plays a roll
