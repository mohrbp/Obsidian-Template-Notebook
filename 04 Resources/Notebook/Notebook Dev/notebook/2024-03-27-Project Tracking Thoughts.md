# Notes

## Background
[2023-10-07 UpdatingProjectTracking](04%20Resources/Notebook/Notebook%20Dev/notebook/2023-10-07%20UpdatingProjectTracking.md)

## Thoughts
- Dealing with the project notebook and Kanban Cards at different levels is a bit confusing
	- Like what have I written about all of the experiments and whats in my regular notebook
		- Dates and something like the github contribution chart might help with that
- Like am I clicking on the project just to open the board?
- Whats the difference between a Card Board and just more "Sub" projects in the folder?
	- Particularly if the Card Board is the folder note and at the top level - Structure looks just the same
-  Is the Kanban providing anything particularly useful now?
	- Main advantage is Drag and Drop
		- This is useful for Wildsea - is it useful here?
		- Using it as a method to update documents is somewhat a liability if this is a shared folder
	- ![](04%20Resources/Notebook/Notebook%20Dev/notebook/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240327142544.png)
- Like if I were to import this [Update Asana Import](04%20Resources/Notebook/Notebook%20Dev/kanban/Update%20Asana%20Import/Update%20Asana%20Import.md)
	- What would I want that a board can provide?
		- I want a notebook for each of these
		- Each of these easily could have objects on its "own board"
	- Its nearly just that its a dashboard that is prettier than what you have
		- Even if its in many ways useless
- I nearly actually want this
	- Where I can see each folder and get an idea of whats inside
		- Folders opening and collapsing is kinda a thing in some of these approach but I'm not sure that's what I'm looking for.
			- Although, I spend a lot of time in the side bar
	- At a glance how many notes, other files, subprojects, active tasks
