# Notes
- Obsidian plugin that runs on Mac to bulk modify the metadata of your notes
- https://github.com/natelandau/obsidian-metadata
- [obsidian-metadata-main zip](04%20Resources/Software/obsidian-metadata-main.zip)
### Using it
- It worked but had a few issues
	- It pulled all of the tags out of all of my notes and put them at the bottom and left [] in their place
		- That's not great.
		- But I also wasn't heavily using tags, so didn't ruin too much
	- Updated all of my "empty" properties to "None"
	- Several frontmatter options were non valid and needed to be fixed with Sublime Text First
- Managed to sanitize and update many of my project properties with this. 
	- So hard to complain too much
