# Notes
## Thinking about Team Notes
- Team notes are going to be particularly important
	- Because
		- Adding [Natalie Gayner](04%20Resources/People/Directory/Natalie%20Gayner.md)
		- [Emily Gamero](04%20Resources/People/Directory/Emily%20Gamero.md) Likes to go back and review
		- Working with [Kate Barkus](04%20Resources/People/Directory/Kate%20Barkus.md) too
	- Where to export
	- What to include
	- I've looked at this before
		- [Cell-free Meeting Note Template](01%20Home/2023/Notebook%20Design%20Docs/2023%20Notebook%20Design%20Document.md#Cell-free%20Meeting%20Note%20Template)
		- [A Structure to capture experiments ran by me and my reports](01%20Home/2023/Notebook%20Design%20Docs/2023%20Notebook%20Design%20Document.md#A%20Structure%20to%20capture%20experiments%20ran%20by%20me%20and%20my%20reports)
			-  Experiments are not quite the same as meetings
				- They want meetings, I want experiments
					- Notebook pages in structured folders is probably gonna be enough to get there
						- Need to enforce that structure
- Thinking about adding a task status for "Assigned to someone else"
	- Or passed off to someone else 
		- Would be helpful to aggregate those in their files 
			- Any difference if they are Cell-free or not?
		- Mostly so that I know that I triaged it to them and I follow up with them
