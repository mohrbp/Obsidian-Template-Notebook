# Notes
## Eleven Therapeutics Medium Post
![ELeveNote](04%20Resources/Notebook/Notebook%20Dev/notebook/attachments/ELeveNote.md)

## My Notes
- There's a lot of overlap between Biocontrol and ELNs
	- The SQL based display is really good 
	- Filtered views are somewhat limited
		- Experiments is filtered to you which is nice
- Database of protocols linked to this would be very helpful
	- Worth discussing this component with Quality
	- Actually also worth talking to quality about ELN - curious if they have thoughts
# Tasks
