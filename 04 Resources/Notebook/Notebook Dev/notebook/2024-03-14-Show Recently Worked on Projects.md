# Notes
- Need a way to show what I've been working on recently
	- Maybe not the exact notes but even the categories would go a long way
- Summing effort for tasks
	- https://forum.obsidian.md/t/dataview-js-summing-task-metadata/50874/2
- Worth considering if there is a way to further downselect which tasks show up where
	- Like, is it relevant to have tasks that you don't know how long they'll take 
		- And then already broken down tasks?
		- Could have the sum of time that they will take too (ooooh)
- Need to pull Start Time and Length in to the GTD display 
	- Worth considering how that can be non-obtrusive if you aren't using it  
# Tasks
- [>] [[04 Resources/Notebook/Notebook Dev/kanban/Dashboard/Dashboard.md|Dashboard]] Consider Recents Dashboard
- [ ] Add Start Time and length to GTD
