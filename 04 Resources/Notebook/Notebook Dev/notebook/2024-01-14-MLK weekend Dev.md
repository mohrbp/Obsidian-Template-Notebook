# Notes

### Secret Dev Notebook
- Syncing and tracking my development
	- Basically planning to compare the folder to github and upload everything changed
	- Then copy the whole folder
	- Change the update date when you do that. 
		- Shouldn't be bouncing back and forth on dev very much
		- This is just to keep things together. 
- By not having a projectCategory in the create note, when you hit escape it will show the dev notebook. Seems like tasks and stuff still work fine.
	- Need to update GTD to ignore anything that is null in projectCategory

### Projects Updates 
- Tasks need a bit of reformatting
	- Color coding is agressive. Everything is red all the time
	- I don't wanna see so many task on everything, break the limits to variables at the top of the view
		- Eventually they could be inputs
- Creation of projects also needs a few QoL updates
	- Calling the board "experiments" is annoying
		- That's not fitting everywhere 
		- Need to check what else calls that by name
	- Is there really no way to combine the +/- board workflows?
		- That's a pretty big source of duplication at the moment
	- The way cards are made is fairly duplicated too
		- It would be nice not to have to make the experiment folder version every time and to have a bit more flexibility about the type of board you make with a project
		- Its currently a weird lock in

#### Cleaning up the Board Name and Duplication
- Looks like the New Card workflow references the Experiments board by name directly
	- I'd like to track the board in the project folder note metadata
		- Could use just the word, but then if its updated it won't auto update
		- Add a link to the board to all the project metadata
			- That will take a while to do retroactively
	-  

##### Board Types
- Experiment Board
- Kanban
	- Dated or Not
		- Take the default note content
- Task Board
