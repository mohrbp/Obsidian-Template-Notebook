# Notes
- This is somewhat of a problem with the "Inbox" 
	- but also a consideration for how you are going to import your notes from 2022
- Notes could live in the inbox for X time at most and then get sorted into Topics (or Projects?)
	- Could be an excuse to actually make Topics happen
	- Work Topics are a huge mess and will take some real work to update
		- So will importing from 2022
			- That's just a huge refactoring issue
			- Maybe a smart Templater script + Note refactor could do it
				- Time consuming....
