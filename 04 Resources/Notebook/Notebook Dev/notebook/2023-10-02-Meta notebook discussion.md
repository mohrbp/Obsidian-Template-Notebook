# Notes
## Meta notebook discussion
- This is the first week with a huge jump in the amount of [[Templater]] scripts you are running 
	- Expecting to do some iteration and fiddling around what works
	- I know I need a way to schedule meetings into the future
		- I don't currently have much of a meeting template
			- What does it need to include?
			- Anything different than a project note with people in it?
				- Knowing its tagged as a meeting helps
				- Difference between created and happens date
	- Created and Modified could be a lot of richer and more usable as a dashboard
		- Like I really need to be able to obviously see what I was most recently working on - not so much even for display purposes, but just navigation
			- Maybe things dated today too should have a precedence
		- More information about the documents would help too
		- Can I change the formatting at all?
		- [>] [[04 Resources/Notebook/Notebook Dev/notebook/2023-10-07 TaskManagement]] Review and Update the Created and Modified Dash Board ðŸ“… 2023-10-07
	- Already - being able to link to Project Tasks seems huge 
		- Seems unnecessary but supercharged tags would really be cool here
		- Linking to Projects and Project Tasks is really great for organization
			- Need to find a good way to show that aggregation of tasks
			- Meetings should be generated by task - I think the "Project" header should have fewer things under it
				- Interesting that its mostly just presentations at the moment
				- Folder for Internal and one for external with their own Folder note that generates the meeting template.
				- [>] [[04 Resources/Notebook/Notebook Dev/notebook/2023-10-07 UpdatingProjectTracking]] Re-do Project and Project Tasks meetings setup ðŸ“… 2023-10-06
				- Do you handle meetings about Project Tasks the same way?
					- Probably not - those meetings should just stay in there
					- And only have the larger meetings if you are responsible for reporting out that like
					- Notes forwarded from project meetings are showing up in the same folder as the meeting (because that's child note behavior - is that what you want?)
	- Forward to a specific note doesn't seem bad either
		- Mostly for populating tasks out of meetings and aggregating with links like that.
		- [x] Make Forward to Suggested Note script ðŸ“… 2023-10-02 âœ… 2023-10-03
		- Probably works well with recurring meeting notes too
			- A little trickier because right now you need to click the task to get the new recurring meeting to appear
- Two days (Wed/Thurs) available for Lab work
	- What?
		-  Maybe walk Natalie through the cell-free prep using the Thiolases 
- Need to convincingly finish out PEAcock
	- Emily needs to prepping slides this week for Friday
	- Worth asking what the end product is
