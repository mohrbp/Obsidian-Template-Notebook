# Notes

## Problem
- Each of the projects, etc. with a notebook folder has all of those notes transcluded in the parent folder note
- This is to serve as a long-read traditional notebook of sorts
- Its very annoying to change where notes live, because then you need to update this series of embeds

### some options

#### Templater Burn-in

- Kinda like what you were proposing for the daily log, you could use templater to directly update the text of the project note with the appropriate transcludes
	- It would be nice if you could just bulk update your project files without worrying about running their contents
		- Updating just the appropriate DV queries to avoid the transcluded text is already worrisome 
- How to select
	- notebook folder in subdirectory is not bad
		- leaves you the ability to transclude other folder names
			- Experiments, Meetings, etc
		- Or loop through the folders to transclude everything
- How to burn in
	- Templater - update contents, I guess
	- I know there are some examples of this on the forums
	- This could also be a good use for gpt
