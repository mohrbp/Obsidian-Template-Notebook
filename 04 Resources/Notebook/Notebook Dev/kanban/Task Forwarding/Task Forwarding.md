# Notes
## Problem
- You frequently will write a task in the note that you are using to complete other tasks and then need to move that task to a new note where the new work happens
- Would be nice to keep that link in place and not just copy and paste the task after you create a new note

## Implementation
- Previously, you built a fairly complicated QuickAdd macro to Forward many types of content
- Probably only need to forward to a new note
	- As long as you can add a note to a card, idk why would really would need to forward it to a new Card
# Tasks
- [ ] Re-implement Task Forwarding
