# Notes
## Timelines
- Basically Gannt charts but lighter and more adjustable
- They have gantt
	- ![](01%20Home/2023/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020231013220552.png)
	- Significantly more readable than what I had on the white board
		- Definitely a lot of assumptions made (particularly around assay time and requirements??)
			- How long to get data back from Derek and Scott
			- That IspS "works"
			- Reagent Timing
				- DNA > Media > prene (Alkene Node assay - being cute calling it 'prene)
		- There are definitely navigation issues with this too
	- Should still be really nice to assign things this way and see how we're doing.
	- Exported it just in case? ![](01%20Home/2023/attachments/Q4_CellFree.csv)
## Workflows
- Going through setting up workflows in Asana
	- Theoretically, these will be things that we'll do again so its worth considering how we schedule them 
	- The training video states that you should start by setting the beginning and end points and then work to build out the middle
