# Notes
- I've been considering re-building the basic note as part of the broader move towards the "boards" view instead of using the Kanban plugin


# Tasks
- [ ] Rebuild new page for all folder notes all the time - for attachments
- [ ] Update "User" to just include your own name in people - great for sharing
