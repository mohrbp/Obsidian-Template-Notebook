# Content
## Background/Framing
- Using Sumitomo and PEAcock as examples because they each have a complexity of work for them
## Kanban, Canvas, or a Dashboard
- It doesn't seem like there is a great currently available option for editing metadata directly related to a kanban board and having it reflected
- 
## Reworking Templates
### Project Task
- Project Task template got a lot of the stuff from the Project template
	- Generating meetings and related notes
		- It may be better to try to restrict creating non-summary notes in this folder though
			- New Experiment
			- New Meeting
			- New Literature Review
	- Aggregating 
		- Notes associated to this task
			- Code was a bit funky for that in dataview but I think its working fine
		- Files in this folder 
		- Tasks for this task
			- This is one place GTD may be implemented
				- Show what the next actions are
					- Potentially broken down by the Task Tag
						- To deal with the different types of work that can be done for a task
				- Show where actions haven't been assigned 
					- This is a bit why you are showing the completion bar on the notes
				- Show what you are waiting on
			- In addition to GTD, this is probably where you want to view all of the tasks for the project 
				- By Type and Date
				- A calendar would be wonderful, but you get what you get
### Project
- Project Template
	-  GTD is at the Project level and at Project Task you want the whole set of tasks
		- And at the project (or projects?) level, you want the GTD summary for each project task
