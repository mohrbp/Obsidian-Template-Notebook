### Purpose
- What do you want this to do?
	- A few highlighting options
		- Collect all highlights of a single color in a single file named for the note
			- Comments underneath
		- Collect all highlights of a single color as Keyworded links
		- Make a Folder Note named for the pub 
			- Make a note for each highlight in a given color
			- Prompt for information
				- Color to extract
				- Name for each note?
		- Make a Folder Note named for the pub
			- For a single highlight color, make a note that includes all highlights that contain the same comment

### Resources
- This template and guide are what I want to look into
	- https://forum.obsidian.md/t/zotero-integration-import-templates/36310/105
	- ![](01%20Home/!Inbox/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240106165805.png)
		- This make sense to have comments in bold above highlighted text
			- Makes it clear what is the highlight
		- I like the "todo hack" - that could be helpful
		- Really Like the Dashed line call out style
			- https://github.com/callumhackett/obsidian_polka_theme
		- Idk that this needs a list callout - just highlights around the text
		- Idk that list callouts fix it either, but it would be really nice to be able to link to a specific highlight or figure easily
			- Could do block quotes, but they have bad interoperability and are hard to search for
			- Headings seem like the only option then
		- Would make sense to make a version of each comment/highlight style and then import those rather than editing the Yellow Highlights or 5 Color Concepts directly
- Highlighting text
	- Templater commander for highlighting
		- https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/nu0olr/multicolored_highlighting_in_obsidian/
		- Make sure to add the Css for the corresponding highlights
			- Or edit your own that looks better
	- This just applies the CSS inline, which is pretty good for interoperability
		- https://github.com/chetachiezikeuzor/Highlightr-Plugin
		- Longer CSS would lead to some jumping when editing text potentially. 
			- Newer context menu may solve this
	- There is some weirdness about blue vs purple

### Progress
- Made a new template! 
	- [General Import Template](04%20Resources/Notebook/Zotero%20Templates/General%20Import%20Template/General%20Import%20Template.md)
	- It is composed of several "sub templates"
		- Which are all imported to give the resulting functions

### Other stuff that would be nice
- Literature note metadata
	- First import date/Created date
	- Last import date
	- Reading status
		- I.e. do I need to read this? 
	- Note type
	- Project/Topic/Project Category
- Sort annotations based on page location
	- And probably the X and Y location as well
- Import notes using Templater
- Update notes without overwriting old notes
- Highlight and Comment Aesthetic formatting
	- See example above
	- 
# Tasks
